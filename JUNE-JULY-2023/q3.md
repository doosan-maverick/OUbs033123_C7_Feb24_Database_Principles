## Documentation

Below is documentation that will guide you through the process of creating a database and then implementing the schema for an `employee` table based on the details you provided. After setting up the table, I'll also show you some basic SQL statements to perform operations on this table.

### Step 1: Create Database

First, you need to create a database where your `employee` table will reside. Let's name the database `companyDB`.

```sql
CREATE DATABASE companyDB;
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON companyDB.* TO 'doosan'@'%';
FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
```

### Step 2: Use Database

Before creating the table, make sure you're operating in the `companyDB` database.

```sql
USE companyDB;
```

### Step 3: Create Table

Now, let's create the `employee` table with the columns you specified: `sid`, `sname`, `address`, `age`, `gender`, `department`, `designation`, `year_joined`, and `salary`.

```sql
CREATE TABLE employee (
    sid INT PRIMARY KEY,
    sname VARCHAR(100),
    address VARCHAR(255),
    age INT,
    gender CHAR(1),
    department VARCHAR(100),
    designation VARCHAR(100),
    year_joined YEAR,
    salary DECIMAL(10, 2)
);
```

### Understanding the Data Types

- `INT` for numerical values without decimals.
- `VARCHAR(length)` for strings of variable length, where `length` is the maximum number of characters.
- `CHAR(1)` for gender, assuming you'll use 'M' or 'F'.
- `YEAR` for the `year_joined` column, assuming you only need the year.
- `DECIMAL(10, 2)` for `salary` to include decimals and support a reasonable range for salary figures.

### Basic SQL Operations on `employee` Table

#### Inserting Data

To add an employee to the table:

```sql
INSERT INTO employee (sid, sname, address, age, gender, department, designation, year_joined, salary) VALUES
(1, 'John Doe', '123 Elm St', 30, 'M', 'Engineering', 'Software Engineer', 2022, 75000.00);
```

#### Selecting Data

To retrieve all information about employee:

```sql
SELECT * FROM employee;
```

To retrieve specific information (e.g., names and departments of all employee):

```sql
SELECT sname, department FROM employee;
```

#### Updating Data

To update data for an employee (e.g., if an employee gets a raise):

```sql
UPDATE employee
SET salary = 80000.00
WHERE sid = 1;
```

#### Deleting Data

To delete an employee's record from the database:

```sql
DELETE FROM employee
WHERE sid = 1;
```

These examples cover some basic operations. As you continue learning SQL, you'll encounter more complex queries and operations like `JOIN`, `GROUP BY`, and subqueries, which will allow you to manipulate and analyze data in more sophisticated ways. Keep experimenting with different queries and operations to deepen your understanding of SQL and MariaDB.

Below are the SQL statements based on the operations you've requested for the `employee` table:

### 1) Delete the column named "designation" in the “employee" table

```sql
ALTER TABLE employee
DROP COLUMN designation;
```

### 2) List the name of the employee from the “operational” department

```sql
SELECT sname FROM employee
WHERE department = 'operational';
```

### 3) List the id and the name of male employee who are supervisors

Assuming "supervisor" is a value in the (now removed) `designation` column, and given that column might have been deleted based on the first query, I'll still provide a hypothetical query as if the column exists:

```sql
SELECT sid, sname FROM employee
WHERE gender = 'M' AND designation = 'Supervisor';
```

### 4) Display the name and designation of employee living in Curepipe or Port Louis

Again, assuming the `designation` column exists:

```sql
SELECT sname, designation FROM employee
WHERE address IN ('Curepipe', 'Port Louis');
```

### 5) List the details of all employee whose name starts with "f" and ends with “e”

```sql
SELECT * FROM employee
WHERE sname LIKE 'f%e';
```

### 6) Display details of female employee whose salary is between 30000 and 35000

```sql
SELECT * FROM employee
WHERE gender = 'F' AND salary BETWEEN 30000 AND 35000;
```

### 7) Display details of employee appointed as manager since 2016 or their age greater than 40

Assuming the `designation` column is relevant and exists:

```sql
SELECT * FROM employee
WHERE (designation = 'Manager' AND year_joined >= 2016) OR age > 40;
```

### 8) List the gender and age of employee whose salary is less than 30000 in descending order of address

```sql
SELECT gender, age FROM employee
WHERE salary < 30000
ORDER BY address DESC;
```

These SQL statements are structured to perform operations as per your requirements on a hypothetical `employee` table. Keep in mind, after executing the first query, the `designation` column will no longer exist in the table, so subsequent queries involving that column are provided under the assumption that it exists or for illustrative purposes based on your initial schema.
